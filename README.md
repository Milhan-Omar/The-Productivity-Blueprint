## The-Productivity-Blueprint

This is a simple todo api with a restful api built on Sinatra. Users can register, login and logout. Users can add a todo , mark it as done or yet to be done and delete a todo when they are done.

## User Stories

These are the behaviours/features that the application implements for use by a user.

As a user I would like to:

- Can register, login or logout
- Can add a todo
- Can mark a todo done or yet to be done
- Can delete a todo
